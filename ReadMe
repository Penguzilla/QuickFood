Food Quick Application

Features
Add customers, restaurants (and their menus), drivers, invoices
Search customers and restaurant by name or search all customers and restaurants
Search driver by City or search all drivers
Search invoices by invoice numbers or search all invoices

How to use:
To use this program, run the Search class.
If you are in Eclipse, right-click on Search.java and choose Run As â†’ Java Application.
If you are running from the command line, compile and run it like this:

javac food/Search.java
java food.Search

Navigate the menus by typing the coresponding number and pressing enter

Before creating invoice make sure of the following:
You have added the customer in Customer Options
You have viewed the viewed and know which menu items you want from which restaurant
Please note: You may only order from one restaurant at a time
Ensure the invoice number you are using has not already been used 

Driver and invoice information will save to a .txt file when you select 5 (Exit) on Navigation menu

Note to Reviewer:
When I started this project with the understanding I have of java I thought
the what I had written out in planning.txt would be followed however as I started
coding and doing research I found my code adapted to my new understanding. 
For example I orginally wanted as you will see to put the coding
for saving the drivers and invoices to txt files in Drivers.java and Invoices.java
but then when I went back to task 12 and reread it I decided it would be better to
have a FileHandler class to save them, especially since drivers get added into Search.java 
first. I also for example was going to have everything in Invoice.java in regards to the
menu then realised how complex the invoice class was going to be so decided to rather
make a search class as my main

 I may have in my enthusiasm gone a little beyond the scope of 
the assignment

As this is not yet something covered there is a feature I 
did not add yet that Im hoping to in the future, but what I would have like to have done is created an 
adminstrative login for Food Quick staff and a seperate login/registration for 
customers. This way customer and driver details would not be accessable to 
customers. 
Only Quick Food staff would be able to
Add restaurants and driver
Search customers, drivers and invoices
Access the saved .txt files

My ULM was created before I started the capstone so it does not completely match my code
The <A> however is in there to show methods that would be locked to only Food Quick admins.
